# Reconstruction-of-Color-Image-Using-Principal-Component-Analysis-PCA-

While reviewing linear algebra, I decided to work on some funny projects that will help me to understand the concepts more deeply. In this repo, I have reconstructed a [600,600,3] RGB image using PCA. To undestand this project, one may need to have solid knowledge of eigendecomposition and covariance matrix. I have another repository where i have included these concepts with python codes, basically using Numpy. feel free to have a look there!
